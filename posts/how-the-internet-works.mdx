# 5.3 billion people use the Internet. But very few people know "How it works?".

You take a beautiful photo of the sunset with your phone. You want to share it with your friend who lives far away.

How does your photo get to your friend’s phone? Let’s see how it happens.

## 1. First Mile

First, you press “send.” Your phone makes your photo smaller and changes it into bits. Bits are like tiny pieces of information. Your phone puts the bits into packets, like letters with your photo’s information.

## 2. Cellular Network

Next, the packets go through your phone’s network. Your phone talks to towers, like big radios, that send the packets to each other.

Your phone sends the packets to the nearest tower. The tower sends them to the next tower until they reach a big tower that connects to the internet.

## 3. Internet Backbone

Now, your photo goes into the Internet. The internet is like a fast road of wires and lights that connect networks all over the world.

These wires carry a lot of data, including your photo packets, along different paths. Routers are like smart traffic lights that decide which paths to take.

## 4. Submarine Cables

If your friend lives in another country, your photo goes through tunnels under the sea called submarine cables. These cables are strong and can carry data without stopping.

## 5. Satellite Links

For places that are hard to reach, satellites help. Your photo packets go to a satellite in space, which sends them to another satellite near your friend’s place. Then they connect to the network on land.

## 6. Last Mile

At last, your photo packets reach the tower that is closest to your friend’s phone. From there, they go through the network until they reach your friend's phone.

## 7. Arrival

In a very short time, your friend’s phone gets the packets and puts them back into the original photo. Your friend sees the amazing sunset picture on their screen, even though they are far from you.

It is a simple way to explain how the Internet works. Each step of this journey uses advanced technology and equipment to ensure your photo gets to your friend. It all starts with your click, letting your friend see the same beautiful view you saw.
